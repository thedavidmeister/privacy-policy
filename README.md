# privacy-policy

This is the privacy policy that I use for a few of my companies/projects.

It is packaged up for inclusion in [Hoplon](http://hoplon.io/) projects.

An example is deployed to [Github Pages](https://thedavidmeister.github.io/privacy-policy/).

If you wish to use some or all of this please be aware:

- I am not a lawyer
- Nothing in this repository is intended as legal advice
- This was created for my own use only and isn't fit for any other purpose
- The policy references Australian law
- The policy almost certainly is NOT directly applicable to your project/company/organisation/whatever
- It does come with an MIT license
- Please seek your own legal advice before considering use of anything in this repository

The reasons why this repository exists at all:

- The text content of the privacy policy is publicly visible on my projects anyway
- It is convenient for me to share the policy between projects as a Java .jar
- Other people may find an example implementation of a legal document as a Hoplon component interesting for technical (not legal) reasons
